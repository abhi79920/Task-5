# 📡 Wireshark Packet Analysis Project

This project is a basic network analysis task using **Wireshark** – one of the most powerful open-source packet sniffers used for real-time network traffic capture and protocol inspection.

---

## 🔍 Objective
To capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types such as TCP, DNS, HTTP, and ICMP using Wireshark.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Wireshark (Free tool for packet capture)
- Browser (for generating network traffic)
- Active Internet Connection

---

## 🧪 Steps Followed
1. Opened Wireshark and selected active network interface (Wi-Fi).
2. Started packet capture.
3. Visited a website (e.g., google.com) to generate traffic.
4. Stopped capture after 30–60 seconds.
5. Saved file as `capture.pcapng`.
6. Applied filters: `tcp`, `dns`, `http`
7. Analyzed packet length, source-destination IPs, and protocols.

## 📊 Protocols Identified
- **TCP**: Reliable packet transfer.
- **DNS**: Domain to IP resolution.
- **HTTP**: Web page request/response.
- **ICMP**: Network ping request.

## 📁 Files Included
- `capture.pcapng`: Wireshark packet capture file.
- `Wireshark_Packet_Analysis_Report_by_Suraj_Mishra.pdf`: Final report in PDF format.
- (Optional) PowerPoint presentation if included.

- Learned protocol filtering and packet inspection.
- Understood IP addressing and ports.

### 🌐 Protocol Awareness
- Understood how protocols like TCP, DNS, and HTTP work in real scenarios.
- Analyzed headers, flags, and protocol behavior.
